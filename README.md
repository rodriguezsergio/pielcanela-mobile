Piel Canela Mobile Calendar
===========================

This was an exercise to better understand how to build out a simple isomorphic app. The data originates from a dance school's schedule page where the details for each class is scraped, parsed, and sorted before sending it off to the client. On the client side, it is a straight-forward React app that uses the Google Calendar API to create recurring events.
